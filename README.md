#### Customizable sheet presentations in SwiftUI. Using [`UISheetPresentationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisheetpresentationcontroller) under the hood.

### Features
- Uses the default [`sheet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/sheet(ispresented:ondismiss:content:)) API under the hood, ensuring maximum compatibility & stability.
- Exposes the *exact same* API as the default SwiftUI [`sheet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/sheet(ispresented:ondismiss:content:)) implementation.
- No hacks, follows the best practices for creating represetable views in SwiftUI.
- Configurable using view modifiers, can configure [`UISheetPresentationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisheetpresentationcontroller)
  from any child views in the presented sheet's content view.
- Works with the [`interactiveDismissDisabled(_:Bool)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/interactivedismissdisabled(_:)) modifier.
- Exposes all of the [`UISheetPresentationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisheetpresentationcontroller) configuration options.
- Track the currently selected detent using an [`Environment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment) value. 
- [Well documented API](#documentation), following a similar approach to the Developer Documentation.
- Small footprint, weighing only `34.6kB` when installed via SwiftPM.

# Requirements
The codebase supports iOS and requires Xcode 12.0 or newer

# Installation
## Xcode
Open your project. Navigate to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`. Enter the url `https://github.com/ericlewis/PageSheet` and tap `Next`.
Select the `PageSheet` target and press `Add Package`.

## Swift Package Manager
Add the following line to the `dependencies` in your `Package.swift` file:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ericlewis/PageSheet.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
```
Next, add `PageSheet` as a dependency for your targets:
```swift
.target(name: "AppTarget", dependencies: ["PageSheet"])
```
A completed example may look like this:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "App",
    dependencies: [
        .package(
          url: "https://github.com/ericlewis/PageSheet.git", 
          .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
          name: "AppTarget", 
          dependencies: ["PageSheet"])
    ]
)
```

# Examples
## Example Project
If you are using Xcode 13.2.1 you can navigate to the [`Example`](Example) folder and open the enclosed Swift App Playground to test various features (and see how they are implemented).

## Presentation
`PageSheet` works similarly to a typical [`sheet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)) view modifier.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import PageSheet

struct ContentView: View {
  @State
  private var sheetPresented = false
  
  var body: some View {
    Button("Open Sheet") {
      sheetPresented = true
    }
    .pageSheet(isPresented: $sheetPresented) {
      Text("Hello!")
    }
  }
}
```

`PageSheet` also supports presentation via conditional `Identifiable` objects.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import PageSheet

struct ContentView: View {
  @State
  private var string: String?
  
  var body: some View {
    Button("Open Sheet") {
      string = "Hello!"
    }
    .pageSheet(item: $string) { unwrappedString in
      Text(unwrappedString)
    }
  }
}

extension String: Identifiable {
  public var id: String { self }
}
```

### Customization
`PageSheet` can also be customized using a collection of view modifiers applied to the sheet's content.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import PageSheet

struct ContentView: View {
  @State
  private var sheetPresented = false
  
  var body: some View {
    Button("Open Sheet") {
      sheetPresented = true
    }
    .pageSheet(isPresented: $sheetPresented) {
      Text("Hello!")
        .preferGrabberVisible(true)
    }
  }
}
```

# Documentation

## Presentation Modifiers
#### These modifiers behave exactly the same way as the [`sheet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/sheet(ispresented:ondismiss:content:)) presentation modifiers in SwiftUI.
---

```swift
func pageSheet<Content: View>(isPresented: Binding<Bool>, onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil, content: @escaping () -> Content) -> some View
```
#### Presents a configurable page sheet when a binding to a Boolean value that you provide is true.

> Use this method when you want to present a configurable sheet view to the user when a Boolean value you provide is `true`.

#### Parameters:
- `isPresented`: A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether
to present the sheet that you create in the modifier's
`content` closure.
- `onDismiss`: The closure to execute when dismissing the sheet.
- `content`: A closure that returns the content of the sheet.
---

```swift
func pageSheet<Item: Identifiable, Content: View>(item: Binding<Item?>, onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil, content: @escaping () -> Content) -> some View
```
#### Presents a sheet using the given item as a data source for the sheet’s content.

> Use this method when you need to present a customizable sheet view with content from a custom data source.

#### Parameters:
- `item`: A binding to an optional source of truth for the sheet.
When `item` is non-`nil`, the system passes the item's content to
the modifier's closure. You display this content in a sheet that you
create that the system displays to the user. If `item` changes,
the system dismisses the sheet and replaces it with a new one
using the same process.
- `onDismiss`: The closure to execute when dismissing the sheet.
- `content`: A closure returning the content of the sheet.
---

## Presentation Customization Modifiers
#### These modifiers only take effect when the modified view is inside of and visible within a presented ``PageSheet``. 
##### Note: You can apply these modifiers to any view in the sheet’s view hierarchy.
---

```swift
func preferGrabberVisible(_ isVisible: Bool) -> some View
```
#### Sets a Boolean value that determines whether the presenting sheet shows a grabber at the top.

> The default value is `false`, which means the sheet doesn't show a grabber. A *grabber* is a visual affordance that indicates that a sheet is resizable.
> Showing a grabber may be useful when it isn't apparent that a sheet can resize or when the sheet can't dismiss interactively.
> 
> Set this value to `true` for the system to draw a grabber in the standard system-defined location.
> The system automatically hides the grabber at appropriate times, like when the sheet is full screen in a compact-height size class or when another sheet presents on top of it.

#### Parameters:
- `isVisible`: Default value is `false`, set to `true` to display grabber.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's grabber visiblity.
---

```swift
func detents(_ detents: PageSheet.Detents) -> some View
```
#### Sets an array of heights where the presenting sheet can rest.

> The default value is an array that contains the value ``large()``.
> The array must contain at least one element. When you set this value, specify detents in order from smallest to largest height.

#### Parameters:
- `detents`: The default value is an array that contains the value ``large()``.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's  ``UISheetPresentationController/detents``.
---

```swift
func largestUndimmedDetent(id identifier: PageSheet.Detent.Identifier?) -> some View
```
#### Sets the largest detent that doesn’t dim the view underneath the presenting sheet.

> The default value is `nil`, which means the system adds a noninteractive dimming view underneath the sheet at all detents.
> Set this property to only add the dimming view at detents larger than the detent you specify.
> For example, set this property to ``medium`` to add the dimming view at the ``large`` detent.
> 
> Without a dimming view, the undimmed area around the sheet responds to user interaction, allowing for a nonmodal experience.
> You can use this behavior for sheets with interactive content underneath them.

#### Parameters:
- `id`: An optional ``PageSheet.Detent.Identifier`` value, the default is `nil`.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's largest undimmed `Detent` identifier.
---

```swift
func selectedDetent(id identifier: PageSheet.Detent.Identifier?) -> some View
```
#### Sets the identifier of the most recently selected detent on the presenting sheet.

> This property represents the most recent detent that the user selects or that you set programmatically.
> The default value is `nil`, which means the sheet displays at the smallest detent you specify in ``detents``.

#### Parameters:
- `id`: An optional ``PageSheet.Detent.Identifier`` value, the default is `nil`.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's selected `Detent` identifier.
---

```swift
func preferEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight(_ preference: Bool) -> some View
```
#### Sets a Boolean value that determines whether the presenting sheet attaches to the bottom edge of the screen in a compact-height size class.

> The default value is `false`, which means the sheet defaults to a full screen appearance at compact height.
> Set this value to `true` to use an alternate appearance in a compact-height size class, causing the sheet to only attach to the screen on its bottom edge.

#### Parameters:
- `preference`: Default value is `false`.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's ``prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight`` property.
---

```swift
func widthFollowsPreferredContentSizeWhenEdgeAttached(_ preference: Bool) -> some View
```
#### Sets a Boolean value that determines whether the presenting sheet's width matches its view's preferred content size.

> The default value is `false`, which means the sheet's width equals the width of its container's safe area.
> Set this value to `true` to use your view controller's ``preferredContentSize`` to determine the width of the sheet instead.
> 
> This property doesn't have an effect when the sheet is in a compact-width and regular-height size class, or when ``prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight`` is `false`.

#### Parameters:
- `preference`: Default value is `false`.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's ``prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight`` property.
---

```swift
func preferScrollingExpandsWhenScrolledToEdge(_ preference: Bool) -> some View
```
#### Sets a Boolean value that determines whether scrolling expands the presenting sheet to a larger detent.

> The default value is `true`, which means if the sheet can expand to a larger detent than ``selectedDetentIdentifier``,
> scrolling up in the sheet increases its detent instead of scrolling the sheet's content. After the sheet reaches its largest detent, scrolling begins.
> 
> Set this value to `false` if you want to avoid letting a scroll gesture expand the sheet.
> For example, you can set this value on a nonmodal sheet to avoid obscuring the content underneath the sheet.

#### Parameters:
- `preference`: Default value is `true`.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's ``prefersScrollingExpandsWhenScrolledToEdge`` property.
---

```swift
func preferredSheetCornerRadius(_ cornerRadius: CGFloat?) -> some View
```
#### Sets the preferred corner radius on the presenting sheet.

> The default value is `nil`. This property only has an effect when the presenting sheet is at the front of its sheet stack.

#### Parameters:
- `preference`: Default value is `nil`.
#### Returns: 
- A view that wraps this view and sets the presenting sheet's ``cornerRadius``.
---

## PageSheetView
#### A SwiftUI wrapper view for presentation controllers that manages the appearance and behavior of a sheet.

> This view makes it easier to embed `PageSheetView` in custom navigation solutions such as `FlowStacks` and is meant to be presented using a `sheet` modifier. Other ways of presenting may not work and are not officially supported.

##### Example
```swift
import SwiftUI
import SheetPage

struct ContentView: View {
  @State
  private var sheetPresented = false
  
  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Button("Present Sheet") {
        sheetPresented = true
      }
    }
    .sheet(isPresented: $sheetPresented) {
      SheetPageView {
        Text("Hello World!")
          .preferGrabberVisible(true)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Parameters:
- `content`: A closure that returns the content of the sheet.
#### Returns: 
- A presentation controller wrapped SwiftUI view.


# Known Issues
- Largest undimmed detent seems to affect the dimming of accent color elements in parent views.
